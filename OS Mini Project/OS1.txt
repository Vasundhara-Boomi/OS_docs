The system provides the following functionalities:
File Encryption:
•	Allow users to encrypt a selected file using a strong password.
•	Use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for encryption.
•	Derive encryption keys using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with a user-provided password and a random salt.
•	Enable the download of the encrypted file after encryption.
File Decryption:
•	Enable users to decrypt a previously encrypted file using the same password used for encryption.
•	Use the password and the salt stored within the encrypted file to derive decryption keys using PBKDF2.
•	Utilize AES-CBC decryption to decrypt the file contents.
